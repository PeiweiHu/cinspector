# cinspector - a static C source code analysis framework

Sometimes, we do not require a high degree of accuracy in our analysis of the source code. We simply want to start analyzing the target program immediately within a second, without the complexity of environment configuration, especially for those outdated projects. Cinspector is a lightweight source code analysis framework that focuses on easy-to-use and out-of-the-box analysis. You can perform source code analysis without the need for configuring environment dependencies, compilation, or even a complete project! You can even use cinspector to analyze decompiled pseudocode!
